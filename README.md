# Orin
Orin is a music player based on Karim Abou Zeid\'s open source Phonograph music player,
I always wanted to implement  Aleksandar Tešić\'s designs of a music player that can be found here!
https://material.uplabs.com/posts/a-music-player-in-material-design-a-concept, but haven\'t had the time to start one from scratch,
so well I used Phonograph as a base , I dont have permissions to use these designs yet so I can\'t release the app on the Playstore
